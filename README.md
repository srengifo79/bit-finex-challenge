# Notes

Due to time constraints styling and code could of course be improved and split to improve readability, visuals and performance.

This are some examples:
  - Move all styling to css files and use classnames.
  - Split the component into smaller components such as the rows that could have been shared a component but with flex direction set to reverse to achieve the desired visual.
  - Move static parts outside of the rendering scope of changing states.

There are a lot of improvements and organizing that could be done from how the code is right now.
